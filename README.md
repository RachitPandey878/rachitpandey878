## About me


**RachitPandey878/rachitpandey878** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the biophysics of intrinsically disordered proteins.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning theoretical and computational physics
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mathematical models used to analyze and understand biophysics.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When we dream, one part of our brain creates the story and the other part witnesses the events and                 is shocked by the plot.
